Here‚Äôs a complete Ansible playbook that shows how to handle API pagination using the uri module. This example demonstrates how to loop through offset-based pagination, collect all results, and optionally store them in a file.

‚úÖ Example: API Pagination Using offset and limit

Assume the API returns:

{
  "results": [...],
  "total": 95,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0
}

üîß Ansible Playbook

---
- name: Fetch all paginated API data using Ansible
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    base_url: "https://api.example.com/data"
    limit: 10
    offset: 0
    all_data: []

  tasks:

    - name: Loop to fetch paginated results
      uri:
        url: "{{ base_url }}?limit={{ limit }}&offset={{ offset }}"
        method: GET
        return_content: yes
        status_code: 200
      register: api_response
      until: api_response.json.results | length == 0
      retries: 20  # max pages (you can increase if needed)
      delay: 1

    - name: Set fact for all results (1st batch)
      set_fact:
        all_data: "{{ api_response.json.results }}"

    - name: Fetch all remaining pages
      vars:
        loop_offset: "{{ range(limit, api_response.json.total, limit) | list }}"
      loop: "{{ loop_offset }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: offset
      uri:
        url: "{{ base_url }}?limit={{ limit }}&offset={{ offset }}"
        method: GET
        return_content: yes
        status_code: 200
      register: paginated

    - name: Append results to all_data
      set_fact:
        all_data: "{{ all_data + item.json.results }}"
      loop: "{{ paginated.results }}"
      loop_control:
        label: "{{ item.json.offset }}"

    - name: Write all data to file
      copy:
        content: "{{ all_data | to_nice_json }}"
        dest: "./full_api_data.json"

üìù Notes
	‚Ä¢	This assumes API response includes total, offset, and results.
	‚Ä¢	You can adapt it for page-based or cursor-based pagination as well.
	‚Ä¢	You can enable authentication using headers: in the uri module.

If you give me the real API structure (URL format + sample response), I‚Äôll tailor this playbook exactly for your case.


Here is the complete Ansible playbook to fetch 20,000 records in batches of 2,000 using offset-based pagination and save them into a JSON file.

‚úÖ Ansible Playbook: Paginate in Batches of 2000

---
- name: Fetch API data in batches of 2000 (total 20000 records)
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    base_url: "https://api.example.com/data"  # Replace with your real API
    total_records: 20000
    batch_size: 2000
    all_records: []

  tasks:

    - name: Generate list of offsets (0, 2000, 4000, ..., 18000)
      set_fact:
        offset_list: "{{ range(0, total_records, batch_size) | list }}"

    - name: Fetch records in batches
      uri:
        url: "{{ base_url }}?limit={{ batch_size }}&offset={{ item }}"
        method: GET
        return_content: yes
        status_code: 200
        headers:
          Authorization: "Bearer {{ api_token }}"  # Optional: use if API needs token
      register: paginated_response
      loop: "{{ offset_list }}"
      loop_control:
        label: "Fetching offset {{ item }}"

    - name: Combine all results into all_records
      set_fact:
        all_records: "{{ all_records + item.json.results }}"
      loop: "{{ paginated_response.results }}"
      loop_control:
        label: "Combining results from offset"

    - name: Save all collected data into a file
      copy:
        content: "{{ all_records | to_nice_json }}"
        dest: "./full_api_records.json"

üîß Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Replace https://api.example.com/data with your actual API endpoint.
	‚Ä¢	Replace Authorization header if your API needs a token.
	‚Ä¢	If your API returns data in a different key (e.g., not results), update item.json.results accordingly.

Let me know if you want to:
	‚Ä¢	Use username/password authentication
	‚Ä¢	Push this data to a database or another API
	‚Ä¢	Turn this into a role or AWX job template

I‚Äôll tailor it as per your use case.

Category,Pros,Cons
Speed,Deletes resources very fast across multiple regions and types.,Too fast ‚Äî wrong settings can wipe critical environments instantly.
Simplicity,Easy to install, one command cleanup.,No deep built-in ‚Äúundo‚Äù or rollback mechanism.
Automation,Can be scripted in cronjobs, Jenkins, GitLab CI for auto-sandbox cleanups.,Must be handled carefully ‚Äî automation + destructive tool = risk!
Cost Saving,Cleans up forgotten resources to save big cloud costs in test accounts.,Deleting wrong resources can cause unexpected financial damage if in wrong account.
Tag Filtering,Supports fine control using --target-tags, --exclude-tags, and --older-than.,But tag filtering is basic ‚Äî no complex policy enforcement like Cloud Custodian.
Multi-region,Can nuke across multiple regions in one command.,Regions must be explicitly enabled or listed.
Dry-run Mode,Provides --dry-run to preview without deletion (safe testing).,Dry-run must be remembered ‚Äî default is destructive if --force is used without thinking.
Open Source,Free, no licensing cost.,Maintained by Gruntwork ‚Äî if Gruntwork stops maintaining, community support could slow down.
Supports AWS (full) and Azure (beta),Multi-cloud starting, helpful for hybrid environments.,Azure support is still immature compared to AWS. GCP, OCI not supported at all.
Lightweight,No server install, simple CLI tool.,Not enterprise-grade management like ServiceNow / native cloud policies.
Telemetry,Easy opt-out with DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true.,Default is opt-in telemetry (privacy concern if you don‚Äôt disable it).
Highly Configurable via YAML,Allows config-driven nuking (account allow/block list, resource inclusion/exclusion).,No ‚Äúcomplex condition‚Äù logic ‚Äî YAML configs are simple allow/exclude filters only.
